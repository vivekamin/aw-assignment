## How to setup:

   - Chrome exetension

       - Chrome -> More Tools -> Extensions -> Load unpacked
       - Load `chrome-extension` folder

   - Full-stack(MERN) application:

       * If you are familiar with Docker Just follow the below commands based on OS

           - Dockerized MERN stack developement environment

           - For MacOS and Ubuntu
               - Install Docker
               - Run `docker-compose up`
               - Start coding!
               - Stop containers and removes volumes:  Run `docker-compose down -v` 

           - For Windows
               - Install Docker or DockerToolbox
               - If DockerToolbox, then clone the repo in C:/Users/[username], eg. C:/Users/suman
               - Change port-forward settings in Virtualbox
                (https://www.jhipster.tech/tips/020_tip_using_docker_containers_as_localhost_on_mac_and_windows.html)
               - Run `docker-compose up`
               - Start coding!
               - Stop containers and removes volumes:  Run `docker-compose down -v`

        * After running `docker-compose up` go to `localhost:3000` which is front-end application and you are good to go

        * If not using with docker
            - Install MongoDB
            - Set DATA folder in the `docker-react-express` as database for it
            - go to `express-server` do npm start(as I have sent the node modules also)
            - go to `react-client` do npm start
            - go to `localhost:3000`
